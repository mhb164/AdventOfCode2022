# AdventOfCode2022
This repository is a platform for solving [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) puzzles and contains: 
1. *Core:* A library helps to manage and perform solutions (solving, testing and adding extra solutions)
   - **Puzzle** class: Base class for puzzles (Properties: DayNumber, SampleInput and each part answers)
   - **PuzzleSolution** class: Base class for solutions (contains 'SolvePartOne' and 'SolvePartTwo' method)
   - **SolutionPerformer** class: A generic class for performing tests and solutions
   - **Puzzles** folder 
   - **Solutions** folder 
   - **ActualInputs** folder
2. *Console:* Simple console application for running tests and solutions.
3. *Benchmark:* To benchmark several solutions (My favorite part :star_struck:).

**First try**: I just make it ***Work***

**Other tries**: I make ***Right*** and ***Fast***

## [Day 02: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) ([2 solutions](https://github.com/mhb164/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/AdventOfCode2022/Solutions/Day02))
* I used a tricky way in the part2, by a method to determine what shape may lead to the specific round outcome.
* In the second try, the puzzle language improved by [OOP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop), [Enum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum), [switch expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/switch-expression) and [in parameter modifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/in-parameter-modifier) to increase performance

## [Day 03: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) ([2 solutions](https://github.com/mhb164/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/AdventOfCode2022/Solutions/Day03))
* There is a huge allocation in the first try, so [Span](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1) came and magic happened.
* Some of developers offered [Intersect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.intersect), but in this case a simple loop has better performance.
* The full atomic benchmarks will be found in [My Benchmarks Repo #7](https://github.com/mhb164/Benchmarks/blob/main/_07_AdventOfCodeDay03AtomicBenchmark.cs)

## [Day 04: Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4) ([2 solutions](https://github.com/mhb164/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/AdventOfCode2022/Solutions/Day04))
* First try was a mess! But it's work :sweat_smile:.
* On the second try, each line works could be done separately, so I used [Parallel.ForEach](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.parallel.foreach). I should have dealt with concurrency, thus [Interlocked](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.interlocked) came to the game.
* [Span](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1) still has its magic!
* Benchmark results were awesome, the second try is brilliant.

## [Day 05: Supply Stacks](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) ([3 solutions](https://github.com/mhb164/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/AdventOfCode2022/Solutions/Day05))
* I think the challenge was reading stack from input :grin:
* On the second try, the puzzle language and performance improved.
* On the third try, the solution was redeveloped ([object-oriented](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/oop)).

## [Day 06: Tuning Trouble](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6) ([3 solutions](https://github.com/mhb164/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/AdventOfCode2022/Solutions/Day06))
* [Span](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1) removes unnecessary allocations.
* On the first try, 'HasDuplicate' method wreckÿ≥ all ***Span*** efforts.
* On the second try, 'HasDuplicate' method rewrote by nested for loop and results are pleasing. 
* On the third try, I used [HashSet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1) to find duplicates.
* The full atomic benchmarks will be found in [My Benchmarks Repo #8](https://github.com/mhb164/Benchmarks/blob/main/_08_AdventOfCodeDay06AtomicBenchmark.cs)
